    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>8 thin slices Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>½ lime, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon spicy mesquite-flavored seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chipotle barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>4 Kaiser rolls, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice a small pocket into each chicken breast with a sharp knife. Layer cheese slices, avocado slices, and sliced jalapeno inside the chicken pockets. Pinch chicken breasts closed and secure with toothpicks or skewers; place chicken into a casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, lime juice, mesquite seasoning, and salt together in a bowl; drizzle half of the mixture over chicken breasts. Turn chicken breasts over and drizzle with remaining olive oil mixture; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts on preheated grill and cook for 7 minutes; turn chicken over and brush with BBQ sauce on the cooked side. Continue grilling for about 5 minutes; turn chicken over and apply BBQ sauce to the second cooked side. Cook chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve each chicken breast on a Kaiser roll.</li>
